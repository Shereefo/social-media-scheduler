# README for Next Claude Chat Session

## üéØ What We Just Completed

We implemented **ECS-based database migrations** for the CI/CD pipeline. The solution allows migrations to run as Fargate tasks inside the VPC, solving the problem of GitHub Actions runners not being able to reach the private RDS database.

2. **[CICD_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md](./CICD_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md)** - Complete CI/CD session history (all issues and fixes)
3. **[QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Essential commands and debugging guide

**Background:**
4. **[DEVELOPMENT_SESSION_SUMMARY.md](./DEVELOPMENT_SESSION_SUMMARY.md)** - Frontend development session (for context)

## üöß Current State

### **What's Working**
- ‚úÖ Terraform infrastructure code (VPC, ECS, RDS, ALB, ECR, S3)
- ‚úÖ CI pipeline (linting, testing on PRs)
- ‚úÖ CD pipeline (build, push to ECR, deploy to ECS)
- ‚úÖ Migration task definition (just implemented, not yet deployed)

### **What's NOT Working (Needs Testing)**
- ‚ùå Database migrations (implementation ready, not yet tested)
- ‚ùå Health checks (endpoint not implemented in FastAPI app)
- ‚ùå Application serving traffic (returns 503 due to missing health endpoint)

### **Infrastructure Status**
- **Deployed**: NO (was destroyed to avoid AWS charges)
- **Last Cost**: ~$0.50 for weekend testing
- **Next Deploy**: Will test new migration implementation

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Immediate Next Steps

### **Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure**
```bash
cd tiktimer-infrastructure
terraform apply
```

**What this does:**
- Creates all AWS resources (~60 total)
- Includes new migration task definition
- Generates database password automatically
- Takes ~10 minutes to complete

### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets**
```bash
# After terraform apply:
./scripts/show-github-secrets.sh

# Then add these NEW secrets (in addition to existing ones):
gh secret set MIGRATION_TASK_FAMILY --body "$(terraform output -raw migration_task_family)"
gh secret set APP_SECURITY_GROUP --body "$(terraform output -raw app_security_group_id)"
gh secret set APP_SUBNET_IDS --body "$(terraform output -json app_subnet_ids | jq -r 'join(",")')"
```

**Existing secrets (should already be set):**
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- DB_HOST
- DB_NAME
- DB_USERNAME
- DB_PASSWORD

### **Step 3: Test Migration via CD Pipeline**
```bash
# Make a small change to trigger CD pipeline
git add .
git commit -m "Test ECS-based database migrations"
git push origin main

# Watch pipeline execution:
# https://github.com/Shereefeo/social-media-scheduler/actions
```

**Expected outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Build job pushes Docker image to ECR
- ‚è≥ Migrate job runs ECS task to execute Alembic migrations
- ‚è≥ Deploy job updates ECS service with new image
- ‚ùå Health check will still fail (endpoint not implemented yet)

### **Step 4: Check Migration Results**
```bash
# View migration logs
aws logs tail /ecs/TikTimer-dev-cluster \
  --follow \
  --filter-pattern "migration" \
  --region us-east-2

# Or check in GitHub Actions output
```

---

## üêõ If Migrations Fail

### **Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify GitHub Secrets** are set correctly (especially the 3 new ones)
3. **Check CloudWatch Logs** for migration task output
4. **Verify Security Groups** allow ECS -> RDS communication

### **Common Issues**

**Issue: "Task definition not found"**
```bash
# Verify migration task exists
aws ecs describe-task-definition \
  --task-definition TikTimer-dev-migration \
  --region us-east-2

# If missing, re-run terraform apply
```

**Issue: "Network timeout"**
```bash
# Check security group rules
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --group-ids $(cd tiktimer-infrastructure && terraform output -raw app_security_group_id) \
  --region us-east-2

# App security group should be allowed in DB security group
```

**Issue: "Authentication failed"**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL in task definition
aws ecs describe-task-definition \
  --task-definition TikTimer-dev-migration \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --query 'taskDefinition.containerDefinitions[0].environment'

# Check if password matches terraform output
cd tiktimer-infrastructure
terraform output -raw db_password
```

## üéØ After Migrations Work

### **Priority 1: Implement Health Check Endpoint**

The application needs a `/health` endpoint for the ALB health checks.

**File to edit:** Backend FastAPI application (likely `app/main.py`)

**Code to add:**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy import text
from app.database import engine

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Health check endpoint for AWS ALB"""
    try:
        # Test database connectivity
        async with engine.begin() as conn:
            await conn.execute(text("SELECT 1"))

        return {
            "status": "healthy",
            "database": "connected",
            "service": "tiktimer-api"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Health check failed: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=503,
            detail="Service unavailable"
        )
```

**Test locally:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","database":"connected","service":"tiktimer-api"}
```

**Then deploy:**
```bash
git add app/main.py
git commit -m "Add health check endpoint for ALB"
git push origin main
```

### **Priority 2: Verify Complete Deployment**
```bash
# Get ALB DNS
cd tiktimer-infrastructure
ALB_DNS=$(terraform output -raw alb_dns_name)

# Test health check (should return 200 OK)
curl -v http://$ALB_DNS/health

# Test API docs
curl http://$ALB_DNS/docs
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

**Current State:** All infrastructure destroyed, $0/month

**When Deployed:**
- ~$0.22/hour (~$158/month if left running 24/7)
- For testing: ~$0.50 for a few hours
- **Remember to destroy after testing!**

**Destroy command:**
```bash
cd tiktimer-infrastructure
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

---

## üîë Important Context

### **Why We Implemented ECS-Based Migrations**

The original CD pipeline tried to run migrations directly from GitHub Actions runners, but this failed because:
1. RDS database is in private subnets (no public access)
2. GitHub Actions runners exist outside the VPC
3. Security groups block external connections

**Solution:** Run migrations as ECS Fargate tasks inside the VPC:
- Same network as application containers
- Can reach private RDS instance
- Uses same Docker image and DATABASE_URL
- Logs to CloudWatch for debugging

### **Current Pipeline Flow**
```
1. Push to main branch
2. ‚úÖ Validate infrastructure exists
3. ‚úÖ Build Docker image ‚Üí Push to ECR
4. ‚è≥ Run migrations via ECS task (NEW - not yet tested)
5. ‚è≥ Deploy containers to ECS
6. ‚ùå Health check (fails - endpoint not implemented)
```

### **Target Pipeline Flow**
```
1. Push to main branch
2. ‚úÖ Validate infrastructure exists
3. ‚úÖ Build Docker image ‚Üí Push to ECR
4. ‚úÖ Run migrations via ECS task
5. ‚úÖ Deploy containers to ECS
6. ‚úÖ Health check passes
7. ‚úÖ Application serves traffic via ALB
```

## üéì Key Learnings from This Session

1. **AWS Resource Naming**: Always use `lower()` for RDS and S3 names
2. **Case Sensitivity**: ECS names must match exactly between Terraform and CD pipeline
3. **Module Outputs**: Reference `module.x.output` for generated values, not input variables
4. **Network Isolation**: Private subnets require creative CI/CD solutions
5. **Task Definitions**: Strip metadata fields before registering new revisions
6. **Deployment ‚â† Success**: Running containers doesn't mean working application
