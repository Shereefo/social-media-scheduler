## Project Overview

This application provides a RESTful API for scheduling and managing social media posts. It uses modern asynchronous Python with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy for database operations. The entire application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and development.

### **Inspiration & Motivation**

As a TikTok creator and social media enthusiast, I noticed a significant gap in the market for TikTok-specific scheduling tools. While platforms like Instagram and Twitter had numerous scheduling solutions, TikTok creators were left manually posting content or using generic tools that didn't integrate properly with TikTok's unique API requirements.

Having a passion for optimizing systems and streamlining workflows, I saw this as the perfect opportunity to solve a real pain point in the creator economy. The challenge of building a robust OAuth integration with TikTok's API, combined with the need for reliable scheduling infrastructure, made this an ideal project to showcase full-stack development skills while creating something genuinely useful for the creator community.

This project represents the intersection of my interests in social media, system optimization, and modern web development practices.

---

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /register` - Register a new user
- `POST /token` - Login and get access token
- `GET /users/me` - Get current user information

### Posts
- `POST /posts/` - Create a new post
- `GET /posts/` - List all posts for current user
- `GET /posts/{post_id}` - Get a specific post
- `PATCH /posts/{post_id}` - Update a post
- `DELETE /posts/{post_id}` - Delete a post
- `GET /health` - Check API and database health

### TikTok Integration
- `GET /api/v1/auth/tiktok/authorize` - Get TikTok authorization URL
- `GET /api/v1/auth/tiktok/callback` - Handle TikTok OAuth callback
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/tiktok/disconnect` - Disconnect TikTok account
- `POST /api/v1/auth/tiktok/exchange-token` - Exchange authorization code for token
- `POST /api/v1/tiktok/posts/` - Create a new TikTok post
- `POST /api/v1/tiktok/posts/{post_id}/publish` - Manually publish a TikTok post

---

## Authentication

The application uses JWT-based authentication:

1. Register a user with `POST /register`
2. Obtain a token with `POST /token` (using username and password)
3. Include the token in the Authorization header for protected endpoints:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer your-access-token
   ```

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/register \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"username":"example_user","email":"user@example.com","password":"securepassword123"}'
   ```

2. **User Login:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/token \
        -d "username=example_user&password=securepassword123" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   ```

3. **Using the Token:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/posts/ \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
   ```

4. **Logout (Client-side):** Simply discard the token on the client-side. The server doesn't store token state.

---

## TikTok Integration

This application supports integration with TikTok's API for posting content. The integration is handled through OAuth 2.0 flow.

### Setting Up TikTok API

1. Create a TikTok Developer Account at [TikTok for Developers](https://developers.tiktok.com/)
2. Create a new application in the TikTok Developer Portal
3. Set the redirect URI to match your `TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable
4. Obtain your Client Key and Client Secret and add them to your environment variables

### TikTok OAuth Callback Page

The TikTok OAuth flow requires a callback page that handles the authorization code. We've created a custom HTML page hosted on Netlify to handle this callback:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>TikTok Authorization Successful</title>
    <style>
        /* TikTok-themed styling with gradient background */
        body {
            font-family: 'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif;
            background: linear-gradient(135deg, #25f4ee 0%, #fe2c55 100%);
            /* Additional styling... */
        }
        /* More styling... */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>TikTok Authorization Successful</h1>
        <p>TikTok authorization has been completed successfully.</p>
        
        <!-- Code display section -->
        <div id="code-section">
            <h2>Authorization Code</h2>
            <div class="code-box" id="code-display">Loading...</div>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Token exchange section -->
        <div id="exchange-section">
            <h2>Token Exchange</h2>
            <p>Sending authorization code to your application...</p>
            <div id="exchange-status" class="status hidden"></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
        // Script to extract code from URL and send to backend
        // ...
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This page:
1. Extracts the authorization code from the URL
2. Displays it to the user
3. Automatically sends it to our backend endpoint
4. Shows the status of the token exchange process

To use this approach:
1. Create an HTML file with the above template
2. Deploy it to Netlify or another static hosting service
3. Set the deployed URL as your `TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` in your TikTok Developer Portal and environment variables

### TikTok Authentication Flow

1. **Start OAuth Flow:**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/auth/tiktok/authorize
   ```
   This endpoint will redirect the user to TikTok's authorization page

2. **Handle Callback:**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/auth/tiktok/callback?code=<AUTH_CODE>
   ```
   TikTok redirects back to your Netlify-hosted callback page with an auth code

3. **Exchange for Access Token:**
   The callback page sends the code to your backend endpoint:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/auth/tiktok/exchange-token
   ```

4. **Store Tokens:**
   Tokens are securely stored and associated with the user account, with proper timezone handling for expiration times

### Publishing TikTok Content

1. **Create a TikTok Post:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tiktok/posts/ \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
        -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
        -F "content=Check out my new video!" \
        -F "scheduled_time=2025-04-10T15:30:00Z" \
        -F "video=@/path/to/video.mp4"
   ```

2. **Publish Immediately:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tiktok/posts/1/publish \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
   ```

---

## Database Schema

The current database schema includes the following tables:

### Users Table
```
Table: users
- id (Integer, Primary Key)
- username (String, Unique)
- email (String, Unique)
- hashed_password (String)
- is_active (Boolean)
- is_superuser (Boolean)
- created_at (DateTime)
- updated_at (DateTime)
- tiktok_access_token (String, Nullable)
- tiktok_refresh_token (String, Nullable)
- tiktok_open_id (String, Nullable)
- tiktok_token_expires_at (DateTime with timezone, Nullable)
```

### Posts Table
```
Table: posts
- id (Integer, Primary Key)
- content (Text)
- scheduled_time (DateTime)
- created_at (DateTime)
- updated_at (DateTime)
- platform (String)
- status (String) - "scheduled", "published", "failed"
- user_id (Integer, Foreign Key to users.id)
- video_filename (String, Nullable)
```

### Database Migration

The project uses Alembic for database migrations:

```bash
# Generate a new migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Revert to a specific migration
alembic downgrade <revision>
```

---

## Development Notes

- The application uses async/await for non-blocking database operations
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax is used throughout the project
- Database tables are automatically created at startup with retry logic for reliability
- Failed connection attempts to the database will be retried with exponential backoff
- All endpoints follow RESTful principles
- The application uses Pydantic for data validation and serialization

### Code Style

This project follows these coding standards:
- PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Type hints for function parameters and return values
- Docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Consistent error handling with try/except blocks
- Async/await patterns for database operations and external API calls

### Error Handling

The application implements a consistent error handling strategy:
- Custom middleware for centralized error handling
- HTTP exceptions with appropriate status codes
- Detailed error messages with proper security considerations
- Logging of errors with contextual information
- Database transaction rollback in case of errors

### Dependency Injection

The project uses FastAPI's dependency injection system for:
- Database session management
- User authentication
- Authorization checks
- Configuration loading

---

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

During the development of the TikTok integration, I encountered several significant challenges. Documenting these issues and their solutions may help others implementing similar OAuth flows.

### TikTok OAuth Challenges

#### 1. Redirect URI Requirements
- **Issue**: TikTok rejected localhost URLs for OAuth redirects, preventing local testing
- **Solution**: Set up a Netlify site with HTTPS for the callback page
- **Implementation**: Created a static HTML page that handles the OAuth callback, deployed on Netlify

#### 2. Token Storage Timezone Issues
- **Issue**: Encountered database errors with timezone-aware datetimes
- **Error**: "can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes"
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a migration script to update the database column type
  - Modified the User model to use DateTime(timezone=True)
  - Updated all datetime handling to be consistently timezone-aware
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  # Before
  expires_at = Column(DateTime)
  
  # After
  expires_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))
  ```

#### 3. CORS Limitations
- **Issue**: Browser security prevented the Netlify callback page from making direct requests to localhost
- **Solution**: Implemented a manual code exchange process instead of automatic
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created a mechanism for users to copy and paste the authorization code
  - Added an API endpoint specifically for manual code exchange

#### 4. Authentication Challenges
- **Issue**: Needed to locate and update test user credentials for API authentication
- **Solution**: Used direct database access to verify and update user information
- **Implementation**:
  - Created admin scripts to manage test user accounts
  - Added logging to track authentication flow

#### 5. Environment Variables and Configuration
- **Issue**: Initial issues with environment variables not being properly loaded
- **Solutions**:
  - Fixed configuration problems with the lifespan parameter in FastAPI setup
  - Implemented a more robust environment variable loading system
  - Added validation to ensure all required variables are present
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  # Check for required environment variables on startup
  @app.on_event("startup")
  async def validate_env_vars():
      required_vars = [
          "TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY", 
          "TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET",
          "TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI"
      ]
      
      missing = [var for var in required_vars if not os.getenv(var)]
      if missing:
          raise ValueError(f"Missing required environment variables: {', '.join(missing)}")
  ```

These challenges are typical when implementing OAuth integrations, especially when dealing with the complexities of secure authentication flows, timezone handling, and cross-domain communications between different environments (development vs. production).

- Configures Security Hub for security standards compliance (optional)

### Cost Optimization

Several cost optimization measures have been implemented:

- **Single NAT Gateway**: Using one NAT Gateway instead of one per AZ (saves ~$65-70/month)
- **Free VPC Endpoints**: S3 and DynamoDB endpoints to reduce NAT Gateway data transfer costs
- **Right-sized Resources**: Appropriate instance sizes for development environment
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic transition to cheaper storage classes for older data
- **Fargate Spot (planned)**: For non-critical workloads to reduce compute costs

### Deployment Instructions

#### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform v1.5.0+ installed
- Git for version control

#### Setting Up the Backend
First, set up the Terraform backend for state management:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shereefo/social-media-scheduler.git
cd social-media-scheduler/tiktimer-infrastructure/terraform-backend

# Initialize and apply Terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

#### Deploying the Main Infrastructure
After setting up the backend, deploy the main infrastructure:

```bash
# Navigate to the main infrastructure directory
cd ..

# Initialize Terraform with the S3 backend
terraform init

# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply
```

#### Clean Up Resources
To avoid ongoing charges when not using the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

### Implementation Challenges & Solutions

During the implementation of the AWS infrastructure with Terraform, we encountered and solved several challenges:

#### NAT Gateway Cost Management
- **Challenge**: NAT Gateways are relatively expensive ($32-35/month per gateway).
- **Solution**: Implemented a single NAT Gateway architecture, reducing costs by approximately 66% compared to one per AZ, while maintaining reasonable availability for development.

#### Terraform State Management
- **Challenge**: Team collaboration on infrastructure code requires shared state.
- **Solution**: Set up S3 backend with DynamoDB locking, allowing multiple team members to work on the infrastructure safely.

#### Database Security
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the database is not exposed to the public internet.
- **Solution**: Placed RDS in private subnets and configured security groups to only allow connections from the application tier.

#### Container Configuration
- **Challenge**: Passing sensitive configuration securely to containers.
- **Solution**: Used AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for secrets and configured the ECS task definition to retrieve them securely at runtime.

### Future Enhancements

The following infrastructure components are planned for future implementation:

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployments
- Staging and production environments
- Infrastructure validation tests

#### Advanced Monitoring
- CloudWatch dashboards for key metrics
- CloudWatch alarms for critical thresholds
- Log metric filters for application insights

#### DNS and SSL
- Route 53 for domain management
- ACM for SSL/TLS certificates
- HTTPS enforcement

#### Enhanced Security
- WAF for web application protection
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- Security Hub for compliance monitoring

#### Cost Management
- Reserved Instances for production workloads
- Auto-scaling based on usage patterns
- Scheduled scaling for predictable workloads

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- Check database credentials in your `.env` file
- Verify that Docker containers are on the same network
- Examine Docker logs: `docker-compose logs db`
- Check for database initialization errors: `docker-compose logs api`

### API Connection Issues
- Verify the API container is running: `docker ps`
- Check logs for API initialization errors: `docker-compose logs api`
- Verify that port 8000 is not being used by another application
- Test a basic endpoint with curl: `curl http://localhost:8000/`

### TikTok Authentication Issues
- Verify your TikTok API credentials in `.env`
- Ensure your redirect URI matches what's configured in the TikTok developer console
- Check application logs for detailed error messages from TikTok API calls
- Verify scope permissions in your TikTok developer console
- If the callback page isn't receiving the code, check your browser console for errors
- Verify the Netlify deployment is working by visiting the URL directly
- Check that CORS is properly configured in your FastAPI application:
  ```python
  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app", "http://localhost:3000"],
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
  )
  ```

### Docker Issues
- Restart Docker: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build`
- Remove Docker volumes to start fresh: `docker-compose down -v`
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Verify Docker and Docker Compose versions are up to date

### Alembic Migration Issues
- Check that your alembic.ini file points to the correct database URL
- Verify that all model changes are imported in the migrations/env.py file
- For complex migrations, consider writing manual migration scripts
